    <h1>About TIF and it's founder</h1>
    <p>I am called <b>Iffat Akram</b>.I am a beginner frontend developer and it's my passion to make <b>Muslims</b> rule in technology.It is only possible when we will teach other children even those who they don't have any source to approch me.  
    Founder of <b>TIF</b> wants to make generation especially males responsible about their responsibilities.I want to make them awared that life is not just for earning,fun and peace as well as worshiping. Life is struggling for Islam. It's about struggling to again gain the same dignity that muslims had in the past. We are the people who were sent on Earth to rule the world according to Allah's commands but worshiping 5 times,studying and earning is not enough for us.And women should know they can't beat harrasment as army officers or police officers,they can only do so by becoming good mothers and by producing good human.  </p>
